# FindMyPodcast
If you need help finding my latest podcast episode every week then look no further as this program will directly go to my podcast

This Program only works with chrome

You need to have python and pip downloaded

Once downloaded you need to run the command:
 
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

once you run that command you should be good to go.
